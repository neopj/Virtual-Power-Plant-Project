# Virtual-Power-Plant-Project

25 homes in the Wellington area are taking part in the two-year trial and an additional 10 homes in Christchurch have recently joined a second phase. The locations for the trial have been chosen where the electricity network will benefit from the additional energy and resilience which local solar and battery systems provide. In total, 35 homes have taken part in the 2-year trial from 2017 to 2019. 

This data is stored in the cloud as JSON documents and is available via the Elasticsearch engine. The data visualisation platform using the Kibana platform can also be used as a view of the data. The data consists of 2 years of 10 minutes resolution time series data for approximately 25 homes in Wellington and 10 homes in Christchurch.

The data collected during the VPP project, need to be analysed to find the outcome of the trial.  The primary outcome of this project is to complete a first-pass analysis of the data and explore a range of statistical analyses relating to electricity distribution, battery discharge, and explore other external signals dependencies which may affect the virtual power plant use and utility. In this project, the data collected during the VPP project has to be clean, manipulated and analysed to answer research questions with respect to this project.
